# TODO (For Humans) - AI kept using as scratchpad before name change

## Maybe pre beta

- Quick add current website button
- Built-in bug report button (if easy)

- add url to intention screen
- hide other settings under "advanced settings"
  - openable all the time, open by default same time examples are gone
  - default advanced & example gone when: 2 intentions & have navigated to intention screen once (use local metrics - blocked by)
- add har coded example intention to example.com, link it in settings as example (wizard?)
- add setting to remove save button, and add tolltip that it's reundant (for psychological safety)
- maybe move import/export out of dots. Figure out button colors

# FUTURE- reasses post user interview

## Revenue & Marketing

- Collect (locally stored) metrics on use and use to drive donations (you have avoided rabbit hoes 1k ties, do you want to send me some cash?) - lookup best practices
  - show on dashbord with info about data sharing
- Add "share button" for users to share either extension, or specific intentions, with a link to the app in marketplace (after v1 - needs to have a link)
- paid addons?
  - dark mode (with total vibe makeover)

## Settings

- search/filter
- undo/redo

## UX Improvements

- Show # unparseable intention urls on the extension icon somehow
- power users & a11y review
- Add loading states, error handling

## Technical

- Add proper error handling throughout
- e2e tests
- Maybe: privacy policy, terms of service
