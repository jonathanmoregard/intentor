# Push Guide

We in our pre-push hook, we verify that our branch has a version larger than master's version.
If we don't, the push fails!

### Single Source of Truth

- **package.json** is the single source of truth for versioning

## How to set version & commit

1. **Analyze changes**: start with `git diff HEAD master` and run commands until you have a clear idea of the changes
2. **Create commit summary**: writes succinct title + paragraph summary in chat window
3. **Check version**: `npm run version:check`
4. **Suggest version bump**: AI analyzes changes and suggests semantic version
5. **Approve version**: User confirms AI's version suggestion
6. **Update version**: Use the `package.json` version field - it's our single source of truth
7. **Create the commit**: based on the summary in the chat window
