## E2E - Multi-Tab Testing Scenarios

### Core Functionality Tests

#### 1. Basic Single Tab Flow

**Objective**: Verify basic intention check functionality in a single tab
**Steps**:

1. Configure an intention rule for "facebook.com"
2. Open a new tab and navigate to facebook.com
3. Verify intention page appears with correct intention text
4. Enter the correct intention phrase
5. Verify navigation to facebook.com succeeds
6. Navigate within facebook.com (different pages)
7. Verify no additional intention pages appear

**Expected Results**:

- Intention page shows on first visit
- Correct intention text is displayed
- Navigation succeeds after correct input
- No intention pages on subsequent navigation within same domain

#### 2. Cross-Domain Navigation

**Objective**: Verify allowList clearing when navigating between domains
**Steps**:

1. Configure intention rules for "facebook.com" and "twitter.com"
2. Visit facebook.com, complete intention check, navigate to site
3. Navigate to google.com (different domain)
4. Navigate back to facebook.com
5. Verify intention page appears again

**Expected Results**:

- First visit to facebook.com shows intention page
- Navigation to google.com clears allowList
- Return to facebook.com shows intention page again

#### 3. Multi-Tab Independent Behavior

**Objective**: Verify each tab is evaluated independently based on active tab state
**Steps**:

1. Configure intention rule for "facebook.com"
2. Open Tab A, visit facebook.com, complete intention check
3. Open Tab B, visit facebook.com
4. Verify Tab B shows pause page

**Expected Results**:

- Tab A allows navigation within facebook.com
- Tab B shows pause page on first visit

#### 4. Tab Closure and Reopening

**Objective**: Verify allowList clearing when tabs are closed
**Steps**:

1. Configure intention rule for "facebook.com"
2. Visit facebook.com, complete intention check
3. Close the tab completely
4. Open new tab, visit facebook.com
5. Verify pause page appears

**Expected Results**:

- New tab shows pause page (allowList cleared on tab closure)
- No cached state persists between tab sessions

#### 5. Multiple Intention Rules

**Objective**: Verify behavior with multiple configured sites
**Steps**:

1. Configure intention rules for "facebook.com" and "twitter.com"
2. Open Tab A, visit facebook.com, complete intention check
3. Open Tab B, visit twitter.com, complete intention check
4. In Tab A, navigate to twitter.com
5. Verify pause page appears for twitter.com

**Expected Results**:

- Each domain requires its own intention check
- allowList is domain-specific, not site-specific
- Navigation between different configured sites shows pause pages

### Edge Case Scenarios

#### 6. Rapid Tab Switching

**Objective**: Verify stability during rapid tab operations
**Steps**:

1. Configure intention rule for "facebook.com"
2. Open multiple tabs quickly
3. Navigate to facebook.com in each tab rapidly
4. Complete intention checks in different tabs
5. Switch between tabs rapidly

**Expected Results**:

- No crashes or errors
- Each tab maintains correct state
- Intention checks work correctly in all tabs

#### 7. Tab Duplication

**Objective**: Verify behavior when duplicating tabs
**Steps**:

1. Configure intention rule for "facebook.com"
2. Visit facebook.com, complete intention check
3. Duplicate the tab (Ctrl+Shift+D or right-click → Duplicate)
4. Verify behavior in duplicated tab

**Expected Results**:

- If facebook tab is active when duplicating: duplicated tab enter automatically
- If facebook tab is not active: undefined (whatever is ok)
- Original tab maintains its state
- Each tab operates independently based on current state

#### 8. Incognito/Private Mode

**Objective**: Verify behavior in private browsing mode
**Steps**:

1. Configure intention rule for "facebook.com"
2. Open incognito/private window
3. Visit facebook.com
4. Complete intention check
5. Open another incognito tab, visit facebook.com

**Expected Results**:

- Intention checks work in private mode
- allowList state is maintained within private session
- No data leakage between private and normal modes

#### 9. Extension Reload/Update

**Objective**: Verify state persistence during extension updates
**Steps**:

1. Configure intention rule for "facebook.com"
2. Visit facebook.com, complete intention check
3. Reload extension (developer mode)
4. Navigate within facebook.com
5. Open new tab, visit facebook.com

**Expected Results**:

- Existing tabs maintain allowList state
- New tabs show pause page (fresh allowList)
- Extension reload doesn't affect active tabs

#### 10. Network Interruptions

**Objective**: Verify behavior during network issues
**Steps**:

1. Configure intention rule for "facebook.com"
2. Start navigation to facebook.com
3. Disconnect network during pause page load
4. Reconnect network
5. Complete intention check

**Expected Results**:

- Pause page loads correctly when network returns
- Intention check works after network restoration
